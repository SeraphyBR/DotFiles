* It should not work on arch linux because manjaro uses independent repository and some programs may not be found by pacman.

#### Obs2: I also recently made a [setup script](https://github.com/SeraphyBR/DotFiles/blob/master/setup-dotfiles.sh), but it is available only in Brazilian Portuguese, made for my personal use. It works on Manjaro and Arch Linux.
* It works on Arch Linux, but it will be reported that some packages were not found, since they are from the manjaro repository
