##### Obs: My vscode settings are not present in this repository, they are saved in a private gist, if you are interested, talk to me on the telegram.

#### Rofi Theme:

-   To use my theme for Rofi, download one of the .rasi files from [here](Rofi/Themes) and run the command:

    ```
    sudo cp theme-name.rasi /usr/share/rofi/themes/theme-name.rasi
    ```

-   And then run the `rofi-theme-selector` command to set the theme to be used.

-   Alternatively, just add this to your ~/.config/rofi/config

    ```
    rofi.theme: ~/path/to/theme.rasi
    ```

-   My current theme is based on [flat-orange](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi-themes/blob/master/User%20Themes/flat-orange.rasi).
    I found it in the [rofi-themes](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi-themes/tree/master/User%20Themes) repository,
    in that same place you can get other themes and modify them as I did. For more details on setting up an .rasi file, run the `man rofi-theme` command.

#### TTY Console colors:

-   Method 1:

    -   In the folder [etc](etc), I have a file called [tty-colors](etc/tty-colors), this is a configuration file containing my color scheme used in the Console.
        This color scheme is loaded at the initialization of openrc by calling the [setcolors](https://github.com/SeraphyBR/linux-vt-setcolors)
        program that will apply colors to all TTY's, overriding the default values.

    -   To use in funtoo/gentoo openrc:

        ```
        git clone https://github.com/SeraphyBR/linux-vt-setcolors
        cd linux-vt-setcolors
        sudo make install
        ```

    -   After installing, copy the file [tty-colors](etc/tty-colors) or use one of the ones that are in the program's
        [example-colors](https://github.com/SeraphyBR/linux-vt-setcolors/tree/master/example-colors) directory, to /etc.

    -   And then create the following script called "tty-colors.start" in [/etc/local.d/](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/local.d) :

        ```sh
        #!/bin/sh

        PROGRAM=/usr/local/bin/setcolors
        COLORS=/etc/tty-colors

        if [ -e "$PROGRAM" ] && [ -e $COLORS ]; then
            $PROGRAM $COLORS
        fi

        ```

    -   And then run the following commands, as root, to make the file executable, and loaded by OpenRC at boot time:

        ```sh
        chmod +x /etc/local.d/tty-colors.start
        rc-update add local default
        ```

-   Method 2:
    -   Edit the script [vt-color-sheme.py](./Scripts/vt-color-scheme.py) with your colors in rgb, and follow the instructions present to add to grub, or run and copy the output, and put in the kernel configuration in the "built-in command line" option

#### Touchpad Support:

-   To use enable touch-click, install libinput and create the following file in "/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf"

    ```
    Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "libinput"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Option "Tapping" "on"
        Option "TappingButtonMap" "lmr"
        Option "TappingDrag" "on"
        Driver "libinput"
    EndSection
    ```
