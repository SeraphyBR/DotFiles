#### Rofi Theme:
* To use my theme for Rofi, download one of the .rasi files from [here](Rofi/Themes) and run the command:

``` 
sudo cp theme-name.rasi /usr/share/rofi/themes/theme-name.rasi  
```
* And then run the `rofi-theme-selector` command to set the theme to be used.

* My current theme is based on [flat-orange](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi-themes/blob/master/User%20Themes/flat-orange.rasi).
I found it in the [rofi-themes](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi-themes/tree/master/User%20Themes) repository, 
in that same place you can get other themes and modify them as I did. For more details on setting up an .rasi file, run the `man rofi-theme` command.


#### Linux TTY Console:
* In the folder [etc](etc), I have a file called [tty-colors](etc/tty-colors), this is a configuration file containing my color scheme used in the Console. 
  This color scheme is loaded at the initialization of openrc by calling the [setcolors](https://github.com/SeraphyBR/linux-vt-setcolors) 
  program that will apply colors to all TTY's, overriding the default values. 
  I preferred to use this method of [setcolors](https://github.com/SeraphyBR/linux-vt-setcolors) than using echo.

* To use in funtoo/gentoo openrc: 

``` 
git clone https://github.com/SeraphyBR/linux-vt-setcolors
cd linux-vt-setcolors
sudo make install
```

* After installing, copy the file [tty-colors](etc/tty-colors) or use one of the ones that are in the program's
[example-colors](https://github.com/SeraphyBR/linux-vt-setcolors/tree/master/example-colors) directory, to /etc.

* And then create the following script called "tty-colors.start" in [/etc/local.d/](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/local.d) :

``` sh
#!/bin/sh

PROGRAM=/usr/local/bin/setcolors
COLORS=/etc/tty-colors

if [ -e "$PROGRAM" ] && [ -e $COLORS ]; then
    $PROGRAM $COLORS
fi

```

* And then run the following commands to make the file executable, and loaded by openrc at boot time:

```
sudo chmod +x /etc/local.d/tty-colors.start
sudo rc-update add local default
```

#### Touchpad Support: 
* To use enable touch-click, install libinput and create the following file in "/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf"

```  
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "touchpad"
	Driver "libinput"
	MatchIsTouchpad "on"
	Option "Tapping" "on"
        Option "TappingButtonMap" "lmr"
        Option "TappingDrag" "on"
EndSection 	
```
